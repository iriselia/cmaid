Purify
=====

Purify is a CMaked-based automated build tool. Purify aims to significantly reduce the amount of learning required to fully utilize the productivity of CMake and is designed to enable fast iteration and allow programmers create and maintain source code with ease.

Purify is particularly suited for C++ development with [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) while being mostly compatible with any other build environments supported by CMake.

Purify is a work in progress. If you are not familiar with CMake, it is strongly advisable to use Purify only with Visual Studio.
