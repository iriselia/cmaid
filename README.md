Purify Sample Project - Windows & Mac OS X
=====

Sample program to demonstrate the robust features provided by [Purify](https://github.com/piaoasd123/Purify).

 - Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
 - Clone PurifySampleProject to desktop or download ZIP.
 - Double click to execute "zGenerateProjectFiles.bat".
 - Build and run!
 - Optionally, you can install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and "Add CMake to System PATH". This will accelerate build generation as CMake no longer needs to be downloaded from an externally repository.


 
[Purify](https://github.com/piaoasd123/Purify) is a [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/)-based automated build tool Developed by [Frank Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fpark12). Purify aims to significantly reduce the amount of learning required to fully utilize the productivity of CMake. It is designed to enable fast iteration and allow programmers create and maintain source code with ease.

Purify is particularly suited for C++ development with [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) while being mostly compatible with any other build environments supported by CMake.

**Purify is a work in progress.** If you are not familiar with CMake, it is strongly advisable to use Purify only under Windows or Mac OS X.
